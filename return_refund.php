                            <h4>Returns</h4>
                            <p>You have 30 calendar days to return an item from the date you received it. To be eligible
                                for a return, your item must be unused and in the same condition that you received it.
                                Your item must be in the original packaging.</p>
                            <p>Your item needs to have the receipt or proof of purchase.</p>

                            <h4>Refunds</h4>
                            <p>Once we receive your item, we will inspect it and notify you that we have received your
                                returned item. We will immediately notify you on the status of your refund after
                                inspecting the item.</p>
                            <p>If your return is approved, we will initiate a refund to your credit card (or original
                                method of payment). You will receive the credit within a certain amount of days,
                                depending on your card issuer's policies.</p>
